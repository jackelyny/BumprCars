# BumprCars

BumprCars is a Java and SQL based project done by me in a Java Course(CSCE 156) in Fall 2020. 

In this project, I created an updated invoice system for a business called BumprCars. BumprCars is a local repair and rental shop. Their old system keep tracks of every customer and product information in flat files. This project aims to modernize their system. 

Customer, products and various other information are kept in an SQL database. The Java program utilizes object-oriented programming(OOP) and outputs a summary report and detailed reports for each customer.
